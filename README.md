# Stockpufferfish

Stockpufferfish is a free chess engine developed by Lazar Ionut-Radu as a means of learning more about chess programming. Even though the name was picked as a joke, I use Stockfish for learning purposes. The Stockfish source code can be found here: https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish
